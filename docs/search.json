The film’s performance across both global and regional charts highlights Netflix’s ability to deliver content that resonates across borders while maintaining cultural relevance.\n\n\nShow code\n# Top-performing global films\nglobal_films &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(category, \"Films\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_views = sum(weekly_views, na.rm = TRUE),\n    weeks_global = n_distinct(week),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_hours)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Latin American countries\nlatin_countries &lt;- c(\"Argentina\", \"Brazil\", \"Mexico\", \"Colombia\", \"Chile\", \"Peru\")\n\nlatin_data &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(country_name %in% latin_countries, category == \"Films\")\n\n# Measuring regional global engagement \nregional_hits &lt;- latin_data |&gt;\n  filter(show_title %in% global_films$show_title) |&gt;\n  group_by(country_name, show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    weeks_in_top_10 = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(weeks_in_top_10))\n\n# Results\nglobal_films\nregional_hits"

These metrics show a remarkable feat for content produced outside the United States.\nThese titles demonstrate the culturally resonate storytelling. Maamla Legal Hai, another Hindi-language hit, added 13.3 million hours over two weeks, reinforicing the platform’s ability to connect with viewers through local narratives and social relevance. With a 2023 baseline of 8.5 million in India, the platform’s investment in Hindi-language originals is paying off. As Netflix continues to diversify its slate with more produced dramas, the Hindi market is poised to become a cornerstone of growth for Netflix.\n\n\nShow code\n# Hindi-language titles (manual list if no language column)\nhindi_titles &lt;- c(\"Jaane Jaan\", \"12th Fail\", \"Class\", \"Maamla Legal Hai\", \"Heeramandi\", \"Scoop\")\n\n# Filtering Hindi titles that charted in India but not in the US\nhindi_india &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt; filter(country_name == \"India\", show_title %in% hindi_titles)\nhindi_us &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt; filter(country_name == \"United States\", show_title %in% hindi_titles)\nhindi_exclusive &lt;- anti_join(hindi_india, hindi_us, by = \"show_title\") |&gt; distinct(show_title)\n\n# Estimation of total viewership and subscriber count\nhindi_viewership &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(show_title %in% hindi_exclusive$show_title) |&gt;\n  group_by(show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_weeks = n_distinct(week),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(estimated_users = round(total_hours / (20 * total_weeks))) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_hours))\n\n# Estimation of subscriber growth (2023 vs 2025)\nsubscriber_growth &lt;- tibble(\n  year = c(2023, 2025),\n  estimated_subscribers_millions = c(8.5, sum(hindi_viewership$estimated_users) / 1e6)\n)\n\n# Metrics\nhindi_viewership\n\nsubscriber_growth"

    "text": "Press Release: The Success of K-Pop Demon Hunters in Latin America\nK-Pop Demon Hunters has emerged as a global phenomenon driven by Latin American audiences. With a combined 559 million hours viewed and 335 million views over 14 consecutive weeks in the global Top 10, the film stands as Netflix’s most dominant title in recent quarters. The film charted consistently across countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru. In Argentina alone, it remained in the Top 10 for 14 cumulative weeks, signaling sustained viewer loyalty.\nThis level of engagement suggests that Latin American audiences are deeply receptive to high-concept, globally produced action films - especially those that blend pop culture, genre storytelling, and international flair. The film’s performance across both global and regional charts highlights Netflix’s ability to deliver content that resonates across borders while maintaining cultural relevance.\n\n\nShow code\n# Top-performing global films\nglobal_films &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(category, \"Films\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_views = sum(weekly_views, na.rm = TRUE),\n    weeks_global = n_distinct(week),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_hours)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Latin American countries\nlatin_countries &lt;- c(\"Argentina\", \"Brazil\", \"Mexico\", \"Colombia\", \"Chile\", \"Peru\")\n\nlatin_data &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(country_name %in% latin_countries, category == \"Films\")\n\n# Measuring regional global engagement \nregional_hits &lt;- latin_data |&gt;\n  filter(show_title %in% global_films$show_title) |&gt;\n  group_by(country_name, show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    weeks_in_top_10 = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(weeks_in_top_10))\n\n# Results\nglobal_films\nregional_hits"

    "text": "Executive Summary\nWe propose a federal grant program to reward municipalities that adopt pro-housing (“YIMBY”) policies - streamlining zoning, permitting, and land use to increase housing supply. This program will reduce rent burdens, support working families, and stimulate local economies.\nThis policy will directly benefit essential workers which represent a sizable and politically active constituencies in cities like New York and Houston. In New York City, the FDNY employs over 10,000 firefighters, many of whom face rent burdens that exceed 30% of their income—making affordable housing a critical issue for union leadership. Similarly, Houston’s growing population of home health aides, a workforce dominated by women and people of color, often earns below the median wage and struggles to find housing near their clients. By incentivizing municipalities to expand housing supply, this bill would reduce rent pressure for these workers, allowing them to live closer to their jobs, spend more on local goods and services, and stabilize their families.\nTo identify cities that merit federal support under this YIMBY incentive program, we recommend two simple, transparent metrics. First, the Rent Burden Index measures how much of a household’s income goes toward rent.The higher values indicate a greater financial strain. By tracking changes in this index over time, we can identify cities that are improving affordability. Second, the Composite Housing Growth Score captures how actively a city is building housing, combining two factors: housing permits per capita and housing permits per net new resident. This score reveals which metropolitan cities are expanding supply in response to demand, not just benefiting from population decline. Together, these metrics allow the federal government to target funding toward cities that are growing responsibly and making measurable progress on affordability."

    "text": "Visualization 1 - Rent Burden Change vs Housing Growth\nThe scatter plot demonstrates a strategic lens into how different CBSAs have responded to housing pressures over time. The X-Axis represents a change in rent burden index (End-Start). Positive values (right side) indicate rent burden has increased - suggetsing worsening affordability. The Y-axis represents the average composite housing growth score.Higher values (top) reflect strong housing growth, both per capita and relative to population growth. The Dash lines are a vertical red line at x = 0: separates CBSAs with falling vs rising rent burden.While, the horizontal blue line at y = 50: marks the average housing growth score."

    "text": "Visualization 2 - Rent Burden and Population over time\nThis multi-paneled graph offers a nuanced view on how housing affordability and demographic growth have evolved over time in selected regions. Each panel represents a different CBSA with two time series from 2000 to 2020, wherein the redline is the population (in thousands) & the blueline is the rent burden index (metric - standardized measure of how much income households spend on rent).\nCBSA that show increasing population (red line trending upwards) and decreasing rent burden (blue line trending downward) should be taken into consideration. These regions likely meet the sufficient housing to satisfy the demand, improving affordability without sacrificing growth."
