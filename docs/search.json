The film’s performance across both global and regional charts highlights Netflix’s ability to deliver content that resonates across borders while maintaining cultural relevance.\n\n\nShow code\n# Top-performing global films\nglobal_films &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(category, \"Films\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_views = sum(weekly_views, na.rm = TRUE),\n    weeks_global = n_distinct(week),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_hours)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Latin American countries\nlatin_countries &lt;- c(\"Argentina\", \"Brazil\", \"Mexico\", \"Colombia\", \"Chile\", \"Peru\")\n\nlatin_data &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(country_name %in% latin_countries, category == \"Films\")\n\n# Measuring regional global engagement \nregional_hits &lt;- latin_data |&gt;\n  filter(show_title %in% global_films$show_title) |&gt;\n  group_by(country_name, show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    weeks_in_top_10 = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(weeks_in_top_10))\n\n# Results\nglobal_films\nregional_hits"

These metrics show a remarkable feat for content produced outside the United States.\nThese titles demonstrate the culturally resonate storytelling. Maamla Legal Hai, another Hindi-language hit, added 13.3 million hours over two weeks, reinforicing the platform’s ability to connect with viewers through local narratives and social relevance. With a 2023 baseline of 8.5 million in India, the platform’s investment in Hindi-language originals is paying off. As Netflix continues to diversify its slate with more produced dramas, the Hindi market is poised to become a cornerstone of growth for Netflix.\n\n\nShow code\n# Hindi-language titles (manual list if no language column)\nhindi_titles &lt;- c(\"Jaane Jaan\", \"12th Fail\", \"Class\", \"Maamla Legal Hai\", \"Heeramandi\", \"Scoop\")\n\n# Filtering Hindi titles that charted in India but not in the US\nhindi_india &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt; filter(country_name == \"India\", show_title %in% hindi_titles)\nhindi_us &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt; filter(country_name == \"United States\", show_title %in% hindi_titles)\nhindi_exclusive &lt;- anti_join(hindi_india, hindi_us, by = \"show_title\") |&gt; distinct(show_title)\n\n# Estimation of total viewership and subscriber count\nhindi_viewership &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(show_title %in% hindi_exclusive$show_title) |&gt;\n  group_by(show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_weeks = n_distinct(week),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(estimated_users = round(total_hours / (20 * total_weeks))) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_hours))\n\n# Estimation of subscriber growth (2023 vs 2025)\nsubscriber_growth &lt;- tibble(\n  year = c(2023, 2025),\n  estimated_subscribers_millions = c(8.5, sum(hindi_viewership$estimated_users) / 1e6)\n)\n\n# Metrics\nhindi_viewership\n\nsubscriber_growth"

    "text": "Press Release: The Success of K-Pop Demon Hunters in Latin America\nK-Pop Demon Hunters has emerged as a global phenomenon driven by Latin American audiences. With a combined 559 million hours viewed and 335 million views over 14 consecutive weeks in the global Top 10, the film stands as Netflix’s most dominant title in recent quarters. The film charted consistently across countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru. In Argentina alone, it remained in the Top 10 for 14 cumulative weeks, signaling sustained viewer loyalty.\nThis level of engagement suggests that Latin American audiences are deeply receptive to high-concept, globally produced action films - especially those that blend pop culture, genre storytelling, and international flair. The film’s performance across both global and regional charts highlights Netflix’s ability to deliver content that resonates across borders while maintaining cultural relevance.\n\n\nShow code\n# Top-performing global films\nglobal_films &lt;- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(category, \"Films\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_views = sum(weekly_views, na.rm = TRUE),\n    weeks_global = n_distinct(week),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_hours)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Latin American countries\nlatin_countries &lt;- c(\"Argentina\", \"Brazil\", \"Mexico\", \"Colombia\", \"Chile\", \"Peru\")\n\nlatin_data &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt;\n  filter(country_name %in% latin_countries, category == \"Films\")\n\n# Measuring regional global engagement \nregional_hits &lt;- latin_data |&gt;\n  filter(show_title %in% global_films$show_title) |&gt;\n  group_by(country_name, show_title) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    weeks_in_top_10 = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(weeks_in_top_10))\n\n# Results\nglobal_films\nregional_hits"
